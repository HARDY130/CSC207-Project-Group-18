Pronounced as (I-ta-da-ki-ma-su Nutritional assistant)

**Contributors: Hao Hu, Zihan Jin, Jeffrey Shen, Chuxuan Ai**

## **The What**

Our program is a Nutritional Assistant, which was designed to help users figure out and manage their recommended macronutrient and calorie levels. The program determines a recommended nutritional threshold, allows the user to search up recipes and nutritional information about the dishes they prepare, and can generate a recommended comprehensive meal plan for the entire day, based on user specification.



The nomenclature of our program's name, Romanized: (itadakimasu) comes from Japanese culture, where "„ÅÑ„Åü„Å†„Åç„Åæ„Åô" is a phrase said before eating to express gratitude for the food, the people who prepared it, and the ingredients. It conveys mindfulness and respect toward the act of eating. 

## **The Purpose**

We wanted to promote simple wellbeing and health to all demographics, regardless of allergies, personal health goals, or dietary restrictions. Making use of the EDAMAM api, we wanted to make the various processes of healthy living more accessible by combining these elements into a single program. Whether it was meal-prepping, or tracking macronutrients to maximize weight loss, these tasks can become arduous due to the different sources of information required to adhere to these tasks. Our program aims to simplify this process.

## Software Feature
### Goal-Based Nutrition Tracker
This feature provides a dynamic, user-specific nutrition tracking and goal-setting system. Descriptions are as follows:
> - Calculates the user's daily calorie and macronutrient (carbs, protein, fat) goals based on their body metrics (e.g., height, weight, age, activity level) and fitness objectives (e.g., weight loss, maintenance, muscle gain).
> - Displays progress toward these goals in a visually intuitive manner, using charts and progress bars.
> - Encourages users to achieve balance in their diet by highlighting areas where they are under or over their recommended intake.

``Example Usecase``
A lightly active user with a daily calorie target of 2,241 kcal can quickly see the nutrition goal for him on the panel. Macronutrient breakdowns (carbs, protein, fat) are displayed as progress rings to ensure users stay within their targets while maintaining a balanced diet.

### Meal Planner
This feature helps users create meal plans tailored to their dietary preferences. Descriptions are as follows:
> - Users can select dietary filters such as Balanced, High-Protein, Low-Carb, Low-Fat, Vegan, and more to generate meals that align with their eating habits and preferences.
> - Automatically generates meal options and also ensures that they are nutritionally balanced and align with the user‚Äôs goals, which ensures variety and nutritious.
> - Food nutritional values are displayed below so users can have a clear view of the given options.
> - The food added can be tracked into the nutrition tracker to display the progress.

``Example Usecase``
A user with "Low-Carb" preference can select the "Low-carb" box to receive generated meal options for him to choose from. The user can directly check the carbs data directly below the generated food.

### Food Customizer
This feature allows users to create customized meal options by entering specific keywords (e.g., "chicken", "salad", or "pasta"). Descriptions are as follows:
> - It generates a list of matching meals with detailed nutritional information according to the keywords. Users can assign selected meals to a specific meal type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks) with a simple selection option.
> - Ideal for users looking to include specific foods in their diet or experiment with new recipes.
> - Food nutritional values are displayed below so users can have a clear view of the given options, which helps to choose from variety.
> - The food chosen and added can be tracked into the nutrition tracker to display the progress.
> - Provides users with the flexibility to plan their meals while maintaining control over their dietary goals, ensuring a balanced and satisfying daily menu.

``Example Usecase``
The user want to eat chicken for lunch enter the keyword "chicken" and selects Chicken Stir-Fry and assigns it to the Lunch meal type. Then the food data are tracked to add into the daily nutritional goal.
