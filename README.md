## üí° The What

Our program is a Nutritional Assistant, which was designed to help users figure out and manage their recommended macronutrient and calorie levels. The program determines a recommended nutritional threshold, allows the user to search up recipes and nutritional information about the dishes they prepare, and can generate a recommended comprehensive meal plan for the entire day, based on user specification.

The nomenclature of our program's name, Romanized: (itadakimasu) comes from Japanese culture, where "„ÅÑ„Åü„Å†„Åç„Åæ„Åô" is a phrase said before eating to express gratitude for the food, the people who prepared it, and the ingredients. It conveys mindfulness and respect toward the act of eating.

## üéØ The Purpose

We wanted to promote simple wellbeing and health to all demographics, regardless of allergies, personal health goals, or dietary restrictions. Making use of the EDAMAM api, we wanted to make the various processes of healthy living more accessible by combining these elements into a single program. Whether it was meal-prepping, or tracking macronutrients to maximize weight loss, these tasks can become arduous due to the different sources of information required to adhere to these tasks. Our program aims to simplify this process.
