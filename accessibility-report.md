# **PROJECT ACCESSIBILITY REPORT**

### **Principle 1: Equitable Use**

We adhered to this principle by using high-contrast font to background colors, ensuring users with visual impairments are not setback by the interface colors
A feature we could add in the future is support for a screen-reader friendly interface.

### **Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**

We accommodated for diverse preference and needs through various methods
Method 1. Was allowing users to input Allergies in the sign-up page so that relevant and appropriate meal generations would be recommended
Method 2. Was allowing users to choose from specific diets, ensuring that whether the user had a specific health goal , or dietary restriction, users would not feel disadvantaged by barriers inadvertently caused by the social model of disability.

### **Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**

We designed our graphical interface to be clean and concise, with a comprehensive README file that makes usage of the program simple, regardless of experience with opening electronic devices or programs.
A specific example would be our macro-nutrient and calorie bars, which were designed to be large and visible so that users can easily extract information from the visualizations.

### **Principle 4: Perceptible Information**

In the future, we would plan to add photos accompanying the specified meal entered/ generated. Due to some users being unfamiliar with the recipes/ meals generated, a photo of dish could help users identify it.
Adding text-to-speech from the generated prompts could help visually impaired users make usage of the program, ensuring that the program remains easy to use across all demographics.

### **Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**

In the scenario where users apply wrong filters or enter wrong data about their weight, we allow the user to change this variables at any time, to ensure that we can minimize the consequences of mistakes or incorrect inputs.
When generating Meal Plans, the user can deselect or reselect filters and regenerate meal plans, allowing for new recipes to be generated based on changed specifications.

### **Principle 6: Low physical Effort**

Using the EDAMAM recipe search api endpoint, we were able to incorporate an NLP based search engine that allowed for the lookup of dishes, regardless of regional differences. For example, if a user wanted to enter a recipe exclusive to their culture, they could still enter it in the search and still receive the nutritional information on it.
For the filters specified on the Meal Planner, we made the filters selectable through checkboxes rather than manually typing them, which could become arduous when the user would like to select multiple

### **Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**

A Feature that we could implement in the future to provide an appropriate digital “space” for all users to interact with the API comfortably would be to implement responsive design, which would ensure that the app works well across all devices, whether it is screen readers, smartphones, tablets etc.
Another feature we could implement would be a “lite” version, in which the data from the api can still be received, even in remote areas that may have weak access to internet connections, using minimal bandwidth.
